# October Open Reconciliation — 2026-10-01

Repository: `lostlight530/sci-render-kit`  
Exact starting main: `6093993952b3163d7450696bb0363c5f7e563adf`  
Temporal scope: October 2026 month-open current-state reconciliation (Asia/Shanghai)

## Confirmed current drift

The active maintenance contract derives calendar state from the actual date and reserves `calendar-month-close` for the natural final day of a month. Current `MANIFEST.yaml` still recorded `2026-09-30 / calendar-month-close` after the calendar advanced to 2026-10-01.

This is independently confirmed current temporal drift. It is not inferred from Stage A/B/C, later frontier-research stages, `LONGITUDINAL_INDEX`, or external frontier research.

## Applied correction

- set `current_temporal_status.as_of` to `2026-10-01`;
- return current calendar fields to `month-to-date` / `month_to_date` using their existing encoding styles;
- append the October month-open interpretation to `docs/03-maintenance-and-audit/DOCUMENT_STATUS.md`;
- preserve `calibrated: "2026-09-22"` because temporal freshness is not capability/profile recalibration;
- preserve renderer/backend implementation, active communication contracts, cadence configuration, README/Architecture, AGENTS, frontier-research artifacts, `LONGITUDINAL_INDEX`, FOUR_DAY/FIVE_DAY/SIX_DAY, and Stage A/B/C history unchanged.

## Authority and evidence boundaries

```text
current implementation > machine contracts > current maintenance/authority records > historical snapshots
render success != scientific validity
uncertainty metadata != statistical validation
accessibility support != WCAG certification
maintenance clean != scientific validation
static source inference != executed checker/test/runtime evidence
```

## Evidence status

Executed before delivery:
- fresh current-main recovery;
- open-PR overlap check;
- current MANIFEST temporal-field inspection;
- active maintenance-contract calendar semantics inspection;
- current DOCUMENT_STATUS temporal interpretation inspection.

NOT_EXECUTED:
- local maintenance scanner;
- repository test suite;
- renderer/backend runtime execution;
- benchmark execution;
- scientific/statistical validation;
- accessibility/WCAG certification;
- independent reproduction / R3.

Fresh branch-vs-main comparison, PR-head freshness, and any observed GitHub workflow state are recorded in the PR review/merge evidence rather than pre-claimed here.
