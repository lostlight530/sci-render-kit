# Frontier Research Stage Synthesis — TEMPLATE

> Write this only after the stage's substantive research parts are sufficiently complete. This file does not replace the part records or their source evidence.

## 0. Stage identity

- **Repository:** `lostlight530/sci-render-kit`
- **Stage ID:** `<A / B / ...>`
- **Canonical period:** `<YYYY-QN>`
- **Research window:** `<YYYY-MM-DD> through <YYYY-MM-DD>`
- **Record type:** `<RETROSPECTIVE | LIVE_STAGE>`
- **Synthesis date:** `<YYYY-MM-DD>`
- **Source cutoff:** `<YYYY-MM-DD>`
- **Stage status:** `<READY_FOR_SYNTHESIS | COMPLETE | PARTIAL>`

## 1. Research parts included

| Part | Title | Outcome | Material unresolved issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<A1>` | `<title>` | `<outcome>` | `<issue or none>` |

Identify intentionally excluded or incomplete parts. Do not imply completeness when a material part remains unresolved.

## 2. What changed during the stage

Describe the strongest time-bounded changes supported across the parts: newly introduced systems/methods/standards, maturation/adoption, failures/reversals, promotional or unverified claims, and changes in evidence quality.

## 3. What persisted

Identify durable problems, constraints, and engineering patterns that remained stable.

## 4. Conflicts and counterevidence

Preserve meaningful disagreements between parts or sources.

```text
synthesis != majority vote
repetition != independence
later success != earlier success
current knowledge != historical knowledge
```

Where evidence does not resolve a conflict, keep it unresolved.

## 5. Negative space

Summarize important things the stage did not establish, including missing capabilities, absent independent reproduction, standards without demonstrated adoption, unverified external claims, unknown provenance/influence, and missing archival evidence.

## 6. Repository-level interpretation

Interpret the stage through: **scientific communication, figure evidence, claim binding, uncertainty expression, reproducibility context, accessibility intent, publisher-target workflows, and communication transfer.**

### Independent convergence

What external developments resemble current repository choices without proving influence?

### Deliberate divergence

Where does the repository intentionally maintain a different boundary or architecture?

### Potential gaps

Which developments deserve watch or a separate current-state audit?

### Non-gaps

Which developments are interesting but do not expose a current repository defect?

## 7. Repository-specific hard boundaries preserved

- `render success != scientific validity`
- `claim binding != entailment`
- `uncertainty metadata != statistical validation`
- `publisher profile/alignment != acceptance`
- `accessibility support != WCAG certification`
- `checksum != independent reproduction`
- `communication transfer != inherited authority`

## 8. Temporal reconciliation

For retrospective stages, distinguish what was knowable during the historical window, what later evidence revealed, what the repository did not yet contain, and what it contains now. Do not back-project current semantics into the historical period.

For a stage that crosses repository creation, explicitly distinguish the pre-creation external landscape from post-creation repository history.

## 9. Current repository assessment

- **Current implementation drift confirmed:** `<YES / NO / UNKNOWN>`
- **Current active-contract drift confirmed:** `<YES / NO / UNKNOWN>`
- **Current documentation drift confirmed:** `<YES / NO / UNKNOWN>`
- **Research-only watch items:** `<list>`
- **Separate repair/audit required:** `<YES / NO>`

If no current defect is independently established:

```text
NO_CURRENT_REPOSITORY_DRIFT
NO_RUNTIME_CHANGE
NO_CONTRACT_CHANGE
```

## 10. Stage conclusion

Use `FRONTIER_STAGE_COMPLETE` or `FRONTIER_STAGE_PARTIAL`, followed by a prose conclusion that keeps external research separate from current repository truth.

## 11. Carry-forward questions

- `<question for the next stage or later correction>`
