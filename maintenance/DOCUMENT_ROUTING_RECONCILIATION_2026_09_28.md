# Document Routing Reconciliation — 2026-09-28

Repository: `lostlight530/sci-render-kit`  
Exact starting main: `9ade8834a9294929535235199a84142118b08b6c`  
Scope: current Stage H documentary routing only

## Confirmed current drift

Current repository state contains:

- `maintenance/frontier-research/stage-h-2025-q4/`;
- `maintenance/frontier-research/LONGITUDINAL_INDEX.md` with Stage H / 2025-Q4 integrated into the current documentary relation;
- `maintenance/frontier-research/longitudinal/` with synthesis artifacts only through `LONGITUDINAL_SYNTHESIS_2024_TO_2025_Q3.md`.

Before this repair, the current `DOCUMENT_STATUS.md` and the appended current-routing annotations in `MANIFEST.yaml` stopped at Stage G. That is a document-routing drift, not evidence of implementation or machine-contract drift.

## Authority decision

Authority remains:

```text
current implementation
> machine contracts
> current maintenance / authority records
> historical snapshots
```

Stage A/B/C and later Stage frontier-research artifacts remain historical/non-normative research baselines. Stage H raised a current routing question only because current-main path presence and the current longitudinal owner independently confirmed the newer repository state.

No implementation, active contract, cadence semantics, README/Architecture capability claim, or historical Stage body requires repair.

## Applied correction

- appended a Stage H current-routing reconciliation to `docs/03-maintenance-and-audit/DOCUMENT_STATUS.md`;
- appended a non-semantic Stage H routing annotation to `MANIFEST.yaml`;
- preserved `calibrated: "2026-09-22"` rather than converting documentation freshness into a runtime/capability recalibration;
- did not create or claim a missing A→H longitudinal synthesis;
- did not rewrite FOUR_DAY / FIVE_DAY / SIX_DAY, Stage A/B/C, Stage H, or other historical research bodies.

## Evidence boundaries

```text
render success != scientific validity
uncertainty metadata != statistical validation
accessibility support != WCAG certification
maintenance clean != scientific validation
static source inference != executed runtime evidence
historical Stage research != runtime authority
LONGITUDINAL_INDEX relation != synthesis artifact presence
```

## Checks

Executed in this reconciliation:

- fresh current-main SHA recovery;
- open-PR overlap check;
- Stage H directory presence check;
- LONGITUDINAL_INDEX Stage H relation inspection;
- longitudinal synthesis directory inventory;
- current DOCUMENT_STATUS / MANIFEST routing comparison.

NOT_EXECUTED:

- maintenance scanner;
- repository test suite;
- renderer/compiler/runtime execution;
- scientific/statistical validation;
- accessibility conformance validation;
- independent reproduction / R3.

A post-change aggregate diff and exact-head freshness check are required before merge.
