# Monthly Close Reconciliation — 2026-09-30

Repository: `lostlight530/sci-render-kit`  
Exact starting main: `1680065783e886c52b2c7175dea2ae3eb587be3e`  
Temporal scope: September 2026 natural calendar-month close (Asia/Shanghai)

## Confirmed current drift

Current implementation and maintenance contract derive calendar status from the actual date and define the natural final day of the month as `calendar-month-close`.

Before this correction, current machine-readable fields in `MANIFEST.yaml` still recorded the 2026-09-22 point-in-time state:

```text
current_temporal_status.as_of = 2026-09-22
current_temporal_status.calendar_month_status = month-to-date
maintenance_cadence.current_calendar_status = month-to-date
maintenance.current_calendar_status = month_to_date
```

On 2026-09-30 those fields are no longer current. This is independently confirmed temporal drift; it is not inferred from Stage A/B/C, Stage H, LONGITUDINAL_INDEX, or external frontier research.

## Applied correction

- set `current_temporal_status.as_of` to `2026-09-30`;
- set current calendar status fields to `calendar-month-close` / `calendar_month_close` according to their existing encoding style;
- append a current month-close interpretation to `docs/03-maintenance-and-audit/DOCUMENT_STATUS.md`;
- preserve `calibrated: "2026-09-22"` because temporal maintenance freshness is not a capability calibration event;
- preserve implementation, cadence configuration, active contracts, README/Architecture, AGENTS, frontier-research artifacts, LONGITUDINAL_INDEX, FOUR_DAY/FIVE_DAY/SIX_DAY, and Stage A/B/C records unchanged.

## Authority and evidence boundaries

```text
current implementation > machine contracts > current maintenance/authority records > historical snapshots
render success != scientific validity
uncertainty metadata != statistical validation
accessibility support != WCAG certification
maintenance clean != scientific validation
calendar-month close != reproduction
static source inference != executed checker/test/runtime evidence
```

## Checks

Executed in this reconciliation:

- fresh current-main recovery;
- open-PR overlap check;
- current frontier and longitudinal directory inventory;
- current MANIFEST temporal-field inspection;
- active maintenance-contract month-close semantics inspection;
- current DOCUMENT_STATUS temporal interpretation inspection;
- targeted write-after-read validation and aggregate diff review are required before delivery.

NOT_EXECUTED:

- local maintenance scanner;
- repository test suite;
- renderer/compiler/runtime execution;
- benchmark execution;
- scientific/statistical validation;
- WCAG/accessibility certification;
- independent reproduction / R3.
